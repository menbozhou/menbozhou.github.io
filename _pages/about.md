## 🔬 Research

Her current research project, titled “Modern Shanhaijing: Extraordinary Bodies and the Global Imaginaire in Fin-de-Siècle China,” explores a pivotal historical moment when the Han-ethnocentric worldview was confronted by a Euro-Americentric global imaginaire. Focusing on the construction, global circulation, and local reception of the Victorian concept of freakery, her project investigates how the Chinese negotiated their place in a modernizing world, and how they joined a global imaginaire that pathologized and even enfreaked them as a race. Unlike the widely-accepted viewpoint that attributes China’s conceptualization of the modern world and itself to its absorption of Western influences, she argues that early Chinese media and its audiences participated in a Euro- and Americentric global imaginaire not merely to absorb its ideologically laden information, but also to reshape the discourse through (mis)translating, reprinting, reading, and representing. In this way, she attempts to restore the role that the “cacophonous noise” of marginalized people played in imagining and documenting the modern world.
